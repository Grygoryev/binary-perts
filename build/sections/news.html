 Over the course of the last 15 years, we have grown so much and worked hard to apply the same approach we take to our client work, to our own brand as well. We wanted to celebrate that growth with a nod to where we are heading. This latest iteration introduces a refined mark and a replatformed site.

There, the last few decades have witnessed an amazing socio-cultural experiment that has gone hand-in-hand with the greatest technological and business boom known to man. From Los Angeles and San Francisco to San Diego and Sacramento, we can find some of the most important agencies of our time in this State. It’s where the offices of Frog Design, Code and Theory, BBDO, Fi, Huge, R/GA, Unit9, and Media Monks are located. In this post, we turn our attention to other companies that are a bit less known on the international scene but, likewise, have earned the community’s respect. We invite you to learn more about California by taking a look at our directory.</p></div></div><a class="news-item__more-btn btn" href="">Читать дальше</a></article><article class="news-item"><div class="news-item__main"><img class="news-item__photo" src="img/news/4.png"/><div class="news-item__text-content"><h3 class="news-item__title">Developing an Effective Strategy</h3><p class="news-item__text">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
